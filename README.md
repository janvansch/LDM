Leads Distribution &amp; Management:

I use this project as a learning area where I try to apply practically what I have learned in online courses.
It is all good and well to follow the examples in a course but you need to apply it to a real world problem to gain full understanding.
I created this project as my solution for a work related problem using the technologies I am playing with.

The app is a single page web app that enables the following:
  - The capture of a lead.
  - The allocation of a lead based on the service requested to a practice with suitably qualified advisers.
  - Assigning the lead to an adviser.
  - Recording the progress.
