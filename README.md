Leads Distribution &amp; Management:

I use this project as a learning area where I try to apply practically what I have learned in online courses. It is all good and well to follow the examples in a course, but you need to apply it to a real-world problem to gain full understanding. I created this project as my solution for a work-related problem using the technologies I am playing with.

I have changed the focus of the solution. Say a company has a website from which a prospect can call a contact centre or request to be contacted. The call or the mail would be routed to a contact centre agent who would process the request. In case of a mail the agent will call the prospect.

The agent would assess if the company can provide the service the prospect requires. If so, the agent will create a lead in this app. If the agent can provide the service, the agent will indicate that the lead must be assign to the agent. If not, the agent will indicate that a suitably qualified adviser must be assigned to meet with the potential client. Lead are assigned based on the location of the client and the area in which the adviser works and accreditation of the adviser.

The app is a single page web app that enables the following:
  - The capture of a lead.
  - The assignment of an agent if the agent can provide the service.
  - The allocation of a lead based on the service requested to a practice with suitably qualified advisers.
  - The practice assigns the lead to an available adviser.
  - The adviser records the progress.

Although all the required functionality has not been implemented, I'm going to start convert the code to ES6 and Sass to gain practical experience with these features. In the future I think I will start using React.
