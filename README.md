Leads Distribution &amp; Management:

I use this project as a learning area where I try to apply practically what I have learned in online courses.
It is all good and well to follow the examples in a course but you need to apply it to a real world problem to gain full understanding.
I created this project as my solution for a work related problem using the technologies I am playing with.

The app is a single page web app that enables the following:
  - The capture of a lead.
  - The allocation of a lead based on the service requested to a practice with suitably qualified advisers.
  - Assigning the lead to an adviser.
  - Recording the progress.

Although all the required functionality has not been implemented I'm going to convert the code to be ES6 compatable by using the new ES6 features as far as possible in order to get practical experience with these new JavaScript features.
